# ü§™ Asylum.Net

Asylum.Net is a lightweight library designed to rescue developers from the common runtime issues caused by obfuscation. It provides a set of tools to help developers diagnose and fix issues caused by obfuscation, and provides a set of best practices to help developers avoid these issues in the first place.

## ‚ú® Features

The initial release contains very basic features for identifying obfuscated members in a .NET ecosystem. Consumers can utilize the `RuntimeIdentifierAttribute` to help identify obfuscated members at runtime:

```csharp
[Obfuscation(Feature = "virtualization", Exclude = false)]
[RuntimeIdentifier(nameof(Sample))]
public sealed class Sample;
```

Members can be identified with this attribute using natural means or through an extension method `GetName`:

```csharp
var typeName = typeof(Sample).GetName();
```

Additionally, if you just need to know if a member is marked with the obfuscation attribute, you can use the extension `IsObfuscated` for `MemberInfo` to determine just that:

```cs
var type = typeof(Sample);
if (type.IsObfuscated())
    Console.WriteLine("What have I done?");
```
